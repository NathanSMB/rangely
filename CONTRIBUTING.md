# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue before making a change. 


## Pull Request Process

1. Make sure any changes to functionality are appropriately documented. Use your best judgement on if these belong in the README.md or documented using TypeDoc.
2. Increase the version number in the package.json. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
3. A collaborator will merge the code for you after manual review and approval.

Note: Your pull request will automatically be run through tests and the linter. We will not merge anything untill the tests pass.
